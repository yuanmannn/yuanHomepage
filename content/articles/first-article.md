This is the first article content. Hugo sections allow you to organize content into logical groups, and each section gets its own URL path.

## What are Hugo Sections?

Hugo sections are a way to organize your content into logical groups. When you create a folder under `content/`, Hugo automatically treats it as a section.

## Benefits of Using Sections

- **Organization**: Keep related content together
- **URLs**: Automatic URL structure (`/articles/`, `/news/`, etc.)
- **Templates**: Custom layouts for different content types
- **RSS**: Each section gets its own RSS feed

## Example Structure

```
content/
├── articles/
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── first-article.md
│   └── second-article.md
└── news/
    ├── _index.md
    └── breaking-news.md
```

This creates accessible URLs like:
- `/articles/` (section list)
- `/articles/first-article/` (individual article)
- `/news/` (section list)
- `/news/breaking-news/` (individual news item)
